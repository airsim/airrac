\section sec_description DESCRIPTION

AirRAC is a C++ library of airline revenue accounting classes and
functions, mainly targeting simulation purposes.

(C++ Standard Extensions: http://www.boost.org) library is used.

The library covers the following areas:
- Calculation of yields from statistics on tickets/coupons
- Yield rules: storage, engine, management
- Retrieval of yields for specific booking requests or product assesment
