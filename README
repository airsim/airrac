Building the library and test binary from Git repository:
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Sourceforge Subversion repository is to be found here:
git clone ssh://airrac.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/airrac/airrac airracgit
cd airracgit
git checkout trunk

Then, you need the following packages (Fedora/RedHat/CentOS names here, 
but names may vary according to distributions):
  * cmake
  * gcc-c++
  * stdair-devel
  * boost-devel
  * readline-devel
  * soci-mysql-devel
  * python-devel
  * gettext-devel
  * doxygen
  * tetex-latex (optional)
  * rpm-build (optional)

Building the library and test binary from the tarball:
------------------------------------------------------
The latest stable source tarball (airrac*.tar.gz or .bz2) can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=317250

Then, as usual:
* To configure the project, type something like:
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/user/dev/deliveries/airrac-0.2.0 \
   -DWITH_STDAIR_PREFIX=/home/user/dev/deliveries/stdair-stable \
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug -DINSTALL_DOC:BOOL=ON ..
* To build the project, type:
  make
* To test the project, type:
  make check
* To install the library (libstdair*.so*) and the binary (stdair), just type:
  make install
* To package the source files, type:
  make dist
* To package the binary and the (HTML and PDF) documentation:
  make package
