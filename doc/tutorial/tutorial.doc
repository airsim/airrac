\section tut_introduction Introduction
This page contains some tutorial examples that will help you getting
started using AirRAC. Most examples show how to construct some simple
business objects, i.e., instances of the so-named Business Object
Model (BOM).

\subsection tut_intro_configuration Preparing the AirRAC Project for Development

The source code for these examples can be found in the
<tt>batches</tt> and <tt>test/airrac</tt> directories. They are
compiled along with the rest of the \c AirRAC project. See the User
Guide (\ref users_guide) for more details on how to build the \c AirRAC
project.

\section tut_build_bom_tree Build a Predefined BOM Tree
A few steps:
- \ref tut_build_bom_root
- \ref tut_build_inventory
- \ref tut_build_link

\subsection tut_build_bom_root Instanciate the BOM Root Object

\dontinclude CmdBomManager.cpp

First, a BOM root object (i.e., a root for all the classes in the project) 
is instantiated by the <tt>airrac::AIRRAC_ServiceContext</tt> context object,
when the <tt>airrac::AIRRAC_Service</tt> is itself instantiated. The 
corresponding \c AirRAC type (class) is <tt>airrac::BomRoot</tt>.

In the following sample, that object is named \c ioBomRoot, and is given
as input/output parameter of the
<tt>airrac::CmdBomManager::buildSampleBom()</tt> method:

\skipline ioBomRoot

\subsection tut_build_inventory Instanciate the (Airline) Inventory Object

An airline inventory object can then be instantiated. Let us give it
the "BA" airline code (corresponding to <a
href="http://www.ba.com">British Airways</a>) as the object key. That
is, an object (let us name it \c lBAKey) of type (class)
<tt>airrac::InventoryKey</tt> has first to be instantiated.

\skipline lBAKey

Thanks to that key, an airline inventory object, i.e. of type (class)
<tt>airrac::Inventory</tt>, can be instantiated. Let us name that
airline inventory object \c lBAInv.

\skipline lBAInv

\subsection tut_build_link Link the Inventory Object with the BOM Root

Then, both objects have to be linked: the airline inventory object
(<tt>airrac::Inventory</tt>) has to be linked with the root of the BOM
tree (<tt>airrac::BomRoot</tt>). That operation is as simple as using the 
<tt>airrac::FacBomManager::addToListAndMap()</tt> method:

\line addToListAndMap
\line linkWithParent

\subsection tut_build_inventory_another Build Another Airline Inventory

Another airline inventory object, corresponding to the Air France (<a
href="http://www.airfrance.com">Air France</a>) company, is
instantiated the same way:

\skipline lAFKey
\until linkWithParent

See the corresponding full program (\ref cmd_bom_manager_cpp) for more details.

\subsection tut_dump_bom_tree Dump The BOM Tree Content

\dontinclude BomDisplay.cpp

From the \c BomRoot (of type <tt>airrac::BomRoot</tt>) object
instance, the list of airline inventories (of type
<tt>airrac::Inventory</tt>) can then be retrieved...

\skipline lInventoryList
\line getList

... and browsed:
\skipline const_iterator
\until csvDisplay

See the corresponding full program (\ref bom_display_cpp) for more details.

\subsection tut_result_output Result of the Tutorial Program

When the <tt>airrac.cpp</tt> program is run (with the <tt>-b</tt>
option), the output should look like:

\include airrac.ref

See the corresponding full program (\ref batch_airrac_cpp) for more details.
